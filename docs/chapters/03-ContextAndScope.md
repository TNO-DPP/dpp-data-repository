# Context and Scope

According to legislation and community interest, we identify 3 wide categories for Digital Product Passports:

- Tangible non-fungible products
- Intangible/fungible products (defined by their container, or in mass)
- Digital products (any media/documentation, etc.)

Digital products/media provenance is a growing concern with the growing proliferation of AI-generated media, in diverse fields, such as healthcare, jounrnalism, social media and other concerns. However, they differ from the other categories due to at-least 2 major (obvious) aspects:

- Replication is low-cost, and effortless. Absence of metadata is not indicative of anything specific, but the presence of metadata can be utilized as proof of generation (such as proof of using a specific trusted model), or proof of capture by a human (such as a proof generated by a camera hardware module).
- Any provenance and attribute information can be attached as file manifest or metadata with relatively low effort. Both metadata and data can be packed together. This is opposed to the other categories, wherein for a truly generic infrastructure, the data is stored not locally, but at an independent system, either on the cloud or on the product itself.

In this repository, we focus on the infrastructural component to host the data for tangible and intangible products.

Examples of tangible products:

- Batteries
- Toys
- Textiles

Examples of intangible products:

- Construction material
- Groups of screws/bolts
- Gas or liquid containers (for instance, fuel or battery liquid)
