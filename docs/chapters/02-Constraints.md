# Constraints

Minimal constraints are placed on this project. The focus is upon the generalizability of the components, and thus, the project is accompanied with 3 complex demo concepts that are also used for the purposes of running tests.

Some other known constraints:

- Some aspects are under research, and in the process of development. Attribute-focused access-control is one of the more complex aspects of a product passport, and will not be included in early releases.
- Value-addition applications to be built atop the Digital Product Passports will be not be included in this repository, as the requirements of such applications across various contexts and purposes may vary drastically. Thus, the base substrate is built generically enough that extensions are easily possible.
- This is intended to be a reference implementation for experimentation and testing, and thus, the performance of the application is not expected to be a major focus. For most purposes, the stability will suffice, but a commercial implementation with security guarantees is still recommended over this implementation.
