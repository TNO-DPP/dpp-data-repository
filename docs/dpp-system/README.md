# Introduction

This repository contains the detailed documentation about the various perspectives and concepts related to a DPP Data Infrastructure.
Two of the key aspects required for a DPP ecosystem are implemented as part of TNO-DPP, the DPP Data repository backend, and a visualization frontend.

This is not the final state of the documentation, and additional aspects will be added as the code evolves.

The quick-start document is quick introduction to the data model, some of the interactions and architectural components, and an example instance of a simple TShirt product passport with provenance data.
