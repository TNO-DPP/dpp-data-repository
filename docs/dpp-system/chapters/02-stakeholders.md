# Stakeholders

An initial exploration of potential stakeholders is already done in the context of the Cirpass project, in which many of the common categories of participants were identified, and many possible user stories were documented.  

1. Major participants
    1. Manufacturers and supply chain organizations
    2. Regulators attempting to ensure that all participants follow all relevant legislations, and that value-chain discrepancies can be identified.
    3. End-users attempting to identify information regarding their product
    4. Auditing and credentialing authorities that may certify all or part of an organization's products and activities.
